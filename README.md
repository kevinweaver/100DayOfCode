# 100DaysOfCode
## About
I'm a fulltime Rails dev but I can always learn more.  My fulltime project isn't something I can open source which leaves my github a baren wasteland of dotfiles and failed attempts at starting fun side projects.
I'd like to spend at least an hour each day learning new things, following tutorials, and expanding my knowledge.
*EDIT*
A significant portion of time has passed.  I've gotten a new job at Stitch Fix and my focuses and goals have shifted.
After the hiatus, I am now not sure if the 100 days format and repo is still the direction I want to go, but I will keep my thoughts organized here for now.

## Rules
Every day I will link to the repo, folder, file, or tutorial that I am working on.
I will likely create new repos for each major aspect, and point to them in this list.
I will see how my schedule pans out and do what I can to make time whenever I can.

## Tools I want to play with more
### Frontend
1. [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - UI focused Javascript library
2. [Jest] (https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - React/JS Testing
1. [Redux]() - State management library
1. [React Router]() - Router for react
1. [React Motion]() - Animation library
1. [Immutable js]() - Immutable objects in js
1. [Elm]() - 

### Backend
2. [Go]() - The language B)
2. [Docker]() - Container management
2. [Kubernetes]() - Container orchestartion

### Tools
1. [Google::Cloud::Language]() - NLP API
1. [Alexa Skills Kit]() - Amazon Alexa voice library
1. [ActionCable]() - Rails websockets

## Tools I'd like to research further first
3. [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) - open source PhoneGap competitor
4. [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) - builds on Cordova, libraries for making apps more native looking
5. [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - maybe benefit from more of a backbone in node?

## Tutorials, Material, and Courses
1. You Dont Know JS: Scope and Closures (might consider this book?)
2. All the Angular 2 [tutorials](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)
3. Angular on Rails [tutorial](https://www.angularonrails.com/angular-2-tour-heroes-tutorial-rails-backend/)
4. React Getting Started [tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)
5. React and Redux [tutorial](http://cabin.getstream.io/)


## My Progress

| Day | Task | Progress | Thoughts |
| --- |:--------:| --------:|-----------------------|
| 1   | [Angular2 Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html) | 100% | Pretty different from what I remember of Angular 1 |
| 2   | [Angular2 Tour of Heroes Tutorial: Part 1](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)| 10% | Still preliminary stuff |
| 3   | [Angular2 Tour of Heroes Tutorial: Part 2+3](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt2.html)| 30% | I likely won't use angular with EMS Heroes, but React is looking like a good option for it. |
| 4   | [Angular2 Tour of Heroes Tutorial: Part 4+5](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt3.html)| 30% | Once I'm done this, I'll do another couple angular tutorials.  Then, the rails + angular one.  Then I'll throw together a basic birdsign app. |
| 5   | [Angular2 Tour of Heroes Tutorial: Part 4+5](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt5.html)| 50% | Working on routing.  Angular is powerful... One more day should finish this tutorial.|
| 6   | [React] | 0% |
