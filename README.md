# 100DaysOfCode
## About
I'm a fulltime Rails dev but I can always learn more.  My fulltime project isn't something I can open source which leaves my github a baren wasteland of dotfiles and failed attempts at starting fun side projects.
I'd like to spend at least an hour each day learning new things, following tutorials, and expanding my knowledge.

## Rules
Every day I will link to the repo, folder, file, or tutorial that I am working on.
I will likely try to keep any micro learning projects inside this repo, unless it is big enough to merit its own repo.
I would like to complete this within 100 days of my start date, but I am also a busy person and I don't want to half-ass it.  If I legitimately don't have time one or two nights a week, I'm not going to pretend I did something.
I will see how my schedule pans out and do what I can to make time whenever I can.

## Tools I already use
1. HTML & CSS
2. HAML & SASS
3. Javascript
4. jQuery
5. Rails
6. Postgres & MySQL
7. AWS
8. bower
9. Bootstrap & Foundation
10. rspec (but stopped using)

## Tools I plan to use
1. [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
2. [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/)
3. [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) - Javascript testing
4. [Teaspoon](https://github.com/modeset/teaspoon) - Javascript testing for rails
4. Scaling with AWS - learn more about the structure of larger apps
5. More testing along the way

## Tools I'd like to look into further first
1. [Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/) - fullstack Javascript framework
2. [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) - MVP Javascript framework
3. [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - UI focused Javascript framework
4. [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) - another js framework
3. [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) - open source PhoneGap competitor
4. [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) - builds on Cordova, libraries for making apps more native looking
5. [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - maybe benefit from more of a backbone in node?

## Tutorials, Material, and Courses
1. You Dont Know JS: Scope and Closures (might consider this book?)
2. All the Angular 2 [tutorials](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)
3. Angular on Rails [tutorial](https://www.angularonrails.com/angular-2-tour-heroes-tutorial-rails-backend/)
